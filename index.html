            <p>jQuery provides simple methods for attaching event handlers to selections. When an event occurs, the provided function is executed. Inside the function, <code>this</code> refers to the DOM element that initiated the event.</p>
            <p>The event handling function can receive an event object. This object can be used to determine the nature of the event, and to prevent the event’s default behavior.</p>
            <p>These methods are used to register behaviors to take effect when the user interacts with the browser, and to further manipulate those registered behaviors.</p>
            
        </section>

        <section id=".click()" class="main-section">
            <header>.click()</header>
            <p>Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.</p>
            <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "click", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "click" )</code> in the third. The <code>click</code> event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element, and the mouse button is pressed and released. Any HTML element can receive this event.</p>
        </section>

        <section id=".mouseenter()" class="main-section">
            <header>.mouseenter()</header>
            <p>Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element.</p>
            <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "mouseenter", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "mouseenter" )</code> in the third.</p>
            <p>The <code>mouseenter</code> JavaScript event is proprietary to Internet Explorer. Because of the event's general utility, jQuery simulates this event so that it can be used regardless of browser. This event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer enters the element. Any HTML element can receive this event.</p>
        </section>

        <section id=".mouseleave()" class="main-section">
            <header>.mouseleave()</header>
            <p>Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element.</p>
            <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on('mouseleave', handler)</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger('mouseleave')</code> in the third.</p>
            <p>The <code>mouseleave</code> JavaScript event is proprietary to Internet Explorer. Because of the event's general utility, jQuery simulates this event so that it can be used regardless of browser. This event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer leaves the element. Any HTML element can receive this event.</p>
        </section>

        <section id=".scroll()" class="main-section">
            <header>.scroll()</header>
            <p>Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.</p>
            <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "scroll", handler )</code> in the first and second variations, and <code>.trigger( "scroll" )</code> in the third.</p>
            <p>The <code>scroll</code> event is sent to an element when the user scrolls to a different place in the element. It applies to <code>window</code> objects, but also to scrollable frames and elements with the <code>overflow</code> CSS property set to <code>scroll</code> (or <code>auto</code> when the element's explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contents).</p>
        </section>

        <section id=".keypress()" class="main-section">
            <header>.keypress()</header>
            <p>Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.</p>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong> as the <code>keypress</code>  event isn't covered by any official specification, the actual behavior encountered when using it may differ across browsers, browser versions, and platforms.</p>
            <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "keypress", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "keypress" )</code> in the third.</p>
            <p>The <code>keypress</code> event is sent to an element when the browser registers keyboard input. This is similar to the <code>keydown</code> event, except that modifier and non-printing keys such as Shift, Esc, and delete trigger <code>keydown</code> events but not <code>keypress</code> events. Other differences between the two events may arise depending on platform and browser.</p>
            <p>A <code>keypress</code> event handler can be attached to any element, but the event is only sent to the element that has the focus. Focusable elements can vary between browsers, but form controls can always get focus so are reasonable candidates for this event type.</p>
        </section>

        <section id=".submit()" class="main-section">
            <header>.submit()</header>
            <p>Bind an event handler to the “submit” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.</p>
            <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "submit", handler )</code> in the first variation, and <code>.trigger( "submit" )</code> in the third.</p>
            <p>The <code>submit</code> event is sent to an element when the user is attempting to submit a form. It can only be attached to <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements. Forms can be submitted either by clicking an explicit <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input type="image"&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;button type="submit"&gt;</code>, or by pressing Enter when certain form elements have focus.</p>
            <p>Depending on the browser, the Enter key may only cause a form submission if the form has exactly one text field, or only when there is a submit button present. The interface should not rely on a particular behavior for this key unless the issue is forced by observing the keypress event for presses of the Enter key.</p>
        </section>

        <section id=".ready()" class="main-section">
            <header>.ready()</header>
            <p>Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded.</p>
            <p>The <code>.ready()</code> method offers a way to run JavaScript code as soon as the page's Document Object Model (DOM) becomes safe to manipulate. This will often be a good time to perform tasks that are needed before the user views or interacts with the page, for example to add event handlers and initialize plugins. When multiple functions are added via successive calls to this method, they run when the DOM is ready in the order in which they are added. As of jQuery 3.0, jQuery ensures that an exception occuring in one handler does not prevent subsequently added handlers from executing.</p>
            <p>Note that although the DOM always becomes ready before the page is fully loaded, it is usually not safe to attach a <code>load</code> event listener in code executed during a <code>.ready()</code> handler. For example, scripts can be loaded dynamically long after the page has loaded using methods such as <code>$.getScript()</code>. Although handlers added by <code>.ready()</code> will always be executed in a dynamically loaded script, the <code>window</code>'s <code>load</code> event has already occurred and those listeners will never run.</p>
            <p>jQuery offers several ways to attach a function that will run when the DOM is ready. All of the following syntaxes are equivalent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>$( handler )</code></li>
                <li><code>$( document ).ready( handler )</code></li>
                <li><code>$( "document" ).ready( handler )</code></li>
                <li><code>$( "img" ).ready( handler )</code></li>
                <li><code>$().ready( handler )</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is also <code>$(document).on( "ready", handler )</code>, deprecated as of jQuery 1.8 and removed in jQuery 3.0. Note that if the DOM becomes ready before this event is attached, the handler will not be executed.</p>
            <p>The <code>.ready()</code> method is typically used with an anonymous function.</p>
